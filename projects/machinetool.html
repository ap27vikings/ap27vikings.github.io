                        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Applied Dykem® Steel Blue Layout Fluid, used combination square with scribe for accurate layout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Resized the sheet using hand metal shear, marked additional cuts and cut to specified dimensions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hole Punching:</strong> Used hole punch machine for precise holes as per blueprint.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bending:</strong> Employed brake machine to bend metal, creating rounded edges and forming the box shape.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brazing:</strong> Used brazing tools for secure, clean joints, controlled brazing temperature to avoid warping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> Filed and ground rough edges with DeWalt® angle grinder, stamped name with alphabetical stamps, applied clear protective coat.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Result</h3>
                    <p>The final product was a well-constructed metal box that met all the specified dimensions and quality standards. This project significantly enhanced my skills in metal layout, cutting, bending, and brazing, providing a thorough understanding of the entire metalworking process. The experience improved my attention to detail, precision, and ability to follow complex procedures accurately. The completed box demonstrated my capability to produce high-quality metalwork with a professional finish.</p>
