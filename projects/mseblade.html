                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Relevant Skills</strong>: SolidWorks, CAD, FDM 3D Printing, Mechanical Design, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Experimental Design, Data Analysis</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Situation</h3>
                    <p>In the context of top-down stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing systems, maintaining consistent resin viscosity is a critical challenge. The viscosity of SLA resins can be affected by various factors, including exposure to UV light, dust, and debris. Over time, resins tend to settle at the bottom of the vat, and cured resin builds up, leading to unpredictable curing properties and reduced print resolution. Current solutions, such as discarding and replacing the resin, are costly and inefficient. This project aims to address these issues by developing a novel mechanical stirring system that maintains a uniform resin mixture throughout the printing process, thereby enhancing the quality and consistency of prints.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Task</h3>
                    <p>The primary objectives of this project were to:</p>
